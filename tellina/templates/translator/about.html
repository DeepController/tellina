			<h3>About</h3>
    	<p>Tellina is a natural language to bash commands translator aiming to reduce end-users' programming and learning efforts. For example, it is able to translate a sentence like "Find text file in the current folder" into a bash command <code>find . -name "*.txt"</code>. The system is written in Python and uses <a href="https://github.com/idank/bashlex">bashlex</a>, <a href="https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/r0.9/get_started/os_setup.html">Tensorflow</a> and Django. Source code is available <a href="https://github.com/TellinaTool/tellina">on github</a>.

    	<h3>How to use Tellina?</h3>
    	<h4>Translating a command</h4> 
    	<p>You can perform the translation from an English sentence to a bash command by typing the sentence in <a href="/">the search page</a> and click the "Translate" button. You can also search your sentence on Google using the shortcut "Search with Google" button. </p>
    	<h4> Interpreting the results</h4>
    	<p>When you are brought to the result page, you will see a list of result entries in the following format.</p>
    	<p>Though our goal is to build a translation system with perfect precision, we are not quite there yet :(. We designed the following interactions to help you understand the commands generated by the system. Thus, before copy-pasting the commands to run on your computer, you can try to understand the suggested commands using the instruction below so that you can confirm the correctness of a command (or modify it when it seems to be incorrect).</p>

    	<ul>
    		<li><b>Code format</b>: Tokens highlighted in <font color="#f5871f">orange</font> are command heads, tokens highlighted in <font color="#8959a8">purple</font> are flags of a command, and tokens with <u>underline</u> are arguments of some command or some flag. You can hover over these tokens to get their explanation based on their man page information.</li>
    		<li><b>Copy a command</b>: You can copy a command to your clipboard by clicking the <img src="/static/img/clippy.svg" width="14"> button on the right hand side of a command. </li>
    		<li><b>Explain a command</b>: You can find the explanation of a command on the <a href="http://explainshell.com/">explainshell.com</a> by clicking the <img src="/static/img/gear.svg" width="14"> button on the right hand side of a command.</li>
